# rusty-car
A CLI for managing car maintenance written in Rust. Not to be confused with [rusty-car](https://github.com/Visgean/rusty-car), a program that controls RC Cars written in Rust (I coulnd't think of a better name...)

## Introduction
I am writing this program as a learning tool to learn the Rust language. I've always wanted to create a simple tool for keeping track of car maintenance items, so in the end I hope this learning experience ends with something functional that I will actually use.
